## Install @clerk/nextjs

Once you have a Next.js application ready, you need to install Clerk's Next.js SDK. This gives you access to prebuilt components and hooks for React, as well as our helpers for Next.js API routes, server-side rendering, and edge middleware.

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  <Tab>``` npm install @clerk/nextjs ```</Tab>
  <Tab>``` yarn add @clerk/nextjs ```</Tab>
  <Tab>``` pnpm i @clerk/nextjs ```</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Set Environment Keys

Below is an example of an .env.local file. To get your keys go to the API Keys page on the Clerk dashboard.

```sh copy filename=".env.local"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
```

## Configure `<ClerkProvider>`

Clerk requires your Next.js application to be wrapped in the `<ClerkProvider/>` component. The `<ClerkProvider />` component wraps your Next.js application to provide active session and user context to Clerk's hooks and other components.

```tsx filename="_app.tsx" copy
import { ClerkProvider } from "@clerk/nextjs";
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider {...pageProps}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

## Building Sign in/up pages

Clerk offers prebuilt components that you can use to easily build and customize sign in, sign up, and other user management features anywhere into your Next.js application. We are going to use the `<SignIn />`,`<SignUp />` components to quickly build completely customizable sign in and sign up pages.

### Authentication settings

Your sign in and sign up options are determined by the settings you specify for your instance in the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.dev). You can choose from an extensive set of settings, and any permutation thereof - including Multi-factor authentication.

- Email codes/links
- Passwords
- Social OAuth Providers
- SMS codes
- TOTP/SMS MFA
- Backup Codes

{/* (Coming Soon: Clerk is also completely extensible and you can include your own functionality using custom actions.) */}

### Sign In page

Clerk uses hash based routing by default, however, for these pages, we are going to use Clerk's path routing and the [Next.js optional catch all route](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes#optional-catch-all-routes). This will set up several routes for you automatically:

{/* Add links to a description of the different types of routing available */}

- /sign-in
- /sign-in/factor-one
- /sign-in/factor-two

```tsx copy filename="/pages/sign-in/[[...index]].tsx"
import { SignIn } from "@clerk/nextjs";

const SignInPage = () => (
  <SignIn path="/sign-in" routing="path" signUpUrl="/sign-up" />
);
export default SignInPage;
```

### Sign Up page

Sign up follows a similar pattern.

```tsx copy filename="/pages/sign-up/[[...index]].tsx"
import { SignUp } from "@clerk/nextjs";

const SignUpPage = () => (
  <SignUp path="/sign-up" routing="path" signInUrl="/sign-in" />
);
export default SignUpPage;
```

### Update your dashboard settings

To make sure you are using the embedded components you will need to update your instance settings in the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.dev) to use the embedded components.

### Customization

TODO talk about Customization

## Accessing Ses and User Data

Clerk provides a set of hooks and helpers that you can use to access the active session and user data in your Next.js application. We have included examples of how to use these helpers in both the client and server side to get you started.

### Client Side

#### `useAuth()`

The `useAuth()` hook is a convenient way to access the current auth state. This hook provides the minimal information needed for data-loading and helper methods to manage the current active session.

```tsx copy filename="pages/example.tsx"
import { useAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default function Example() {
  const { isLoaded, userId, sessionId, getToken } = useAuth();

  // In case the user signs out while on the page.
  if (!isLoaded || !userId) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      Hello, {userId} your current active session is {sessionId}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### `useUser()`

The `useUser()` hook is a convenient way to access the current user data where you need it. This hook provides the user data and helper methods to manage the current active session.

```tsx copy filename="pages/example.tsx"
import { useUser } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default function Example() {
  const { isLoaded, isSignedIn, user } = useUser();

  if (!isLoaded || !isSignedIn) {
    return null;
  }

  return <div>Hello, {user.firstName} welcome to Clerk</div>;
}

export default Home;
```

### Server Side

#### Using Middleware

To use server side functionality, you need to add the following Clerk middleware to your Next.js application. This allows you to access session and user data in your Next.js API routes and server-side rendered pages.

```tsx filename="middleware.ts" copy
import { withClerkMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import type { NextRequest } from "next/server";

export default withClerkMiddleware((req: NextRequest) => {
  return NextResponse.next();
});

// Stop Middleware running on static files
export const config = {
  matcher: "/((?!_next/image|_next/static|favicon.ico).*)",
};
```

#### Server Side Rendering

You can access the active session and user data in your `getServerSideProps` using the `getAuth()` helper.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
Please note the addition of buildClerkProps in the return statement, which informs our React helpers of the authentication state during server-side rendering (like `useAuth()`, `<SignedIn>`, and `<SignedOut>`).
</Callout>

```tsx copy filename="pages/example.tsx"
import { getAuth, buildClerkProps } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";
import { GetServerSideProps } from "next";

export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async (ctx) => {
  const { userId } = getAuth(ctx.req);

  if (!userId) {
    // handle user is not logged in.
  }

  // Load any data your application needs for the page using the userId
  return { props: { ...buildClerkProps(ctx.req) } };
};
```

You can also access the full user object before passing it to the page using the `clerkClient` helper.

```tsx copy filename="pages/example.tsx"
import { clerkClient, getAuth, buildClerkProps } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";
import { GetServerSideProps } from "next";

export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async (ctx) => {
  const { userId } = getAuth(ctx.req);

  const user = userId ? await clerkClient.users.getUser(userId) : undefined;

  return { props: { ...buildClerkProps(ctx.req, { user }) } };
};
```

#### Next.js API Routes

You can protect your Next.js API routes by using the `getAuth()` helper and retrieve data from your own systems.

```tsx copy filename="pages/api/auth.ts"
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import { getAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

export default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  const { userId } = getAuth(req);
  if (!userId) {
    res.status(401).json({ error: "Unauthorized" });
    return;
  }
  // retrieve data from your database
  res.status(200).json({});
}
```

In some cases you may need the full user object, for example, if you want to access the user's email address or name. You can use the `clerkClient` helper to get the full user object.

```tsx copy filename="pages/api/auth.ts"
import { getAuth, clerkClient } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";

export default async function handler(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse
) {
  const { userId } = getAuth(req);

  if (!userId) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: "Unauthorized" });
  }

  const user = userId ? await clerkClient.users.getUser(userId) : null;

  // use the user object to decide what data to return

  return res.status(200).json({});
}
```

## Protecting Pages

### Extending Middleware

Extending Middleware is the most comprehensive way to implement page protection because it will block pages from loading on the server side. Below is a simple example of protecting pages with middleware. This can be further extended to control access based on Clerk's metadata, organization roles, or anything else you build.

```tsx copy filename="middleware.ts"
import { withClerkMiddleware, getAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import type { NextRequest } from "next/server";

// Set the paths that don't require the user to be signed in
const publicPaths = ["/", "/sign-in*", "/sign-up*"];

const isPublic = (path: string) => {
  return publicPaths.find((x) =>
    path.match(new RegExp(`^${x}$`.replace("*$", "($|/)")))
  );
};

export default withClerkMiddleware((request: NextRequest) => {
  if (isPublic(request.nextUrl.pathname)) {
    return NextResponse.next();
  }
  // if the user is not signed in redirect them to the sign in page.
  const { userId } = getAuth(request);

  if (!userId) {
    // redirect the users to /pages/sign-in/[[...index]].ts

    const signInUrl = new URL("/sign-in", request.url);
    signInUrl.searchParams.set("redirect_url", request.url);
    return NextResponse.redirect(signInUrl);
  }
  return NextResponse.next();
});

export const config = {
  matcher: "/((?!_next/image|_next/static|favicon.ico).*)",
};
```

### Using Control Components

Clerk also provides client side control components, the following example shows you how to compose them while leaving your sign in and sign up pages public.

```tsx
import {
  ClerkProvider,
  SignedIn,
  SignedOut,
  RedirectToSignIn,
} from "@clerk/nextjs";
import { AppProps } from "next/app";
import { useRouter } from "next/router";

//
//  List pages you want to be publicly accessible. At a minimum
//  you should include your sign in and sign up pages.
//
//  Use the following naming strategy:
//   "/"              for pages/index.js
//   "/foo"           for pages/foo/index.js
//   "/foo/bar"       for pages/foo/bar.js
//   "/foo/[...bar]"  for pages/foo/[...bar].js
//
const publicPages: Array<string> = [
  "/sign-in/[[...index]]",
  "/sign-up/[[...index]]",
];

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  // Get the pathname
  const { pathname } = useRouter();

  // Check if the current route matches a public page
  const isPublicPage = publicPages.includes(pathname);

  // If the current route is listed as public, render it directly
  // Otherwise, use Clerk to require authentication
  return (
    <ClerkProvider {...pageProps}>
      {isPublicPage ? (
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      ) : (
        <>
          <SignedIn>
            <Component {...pageProps} />
          </SignedIn>
          <SignedOut>
            <RedirectToSignIn />
          </SignedOut>
        </>
      )}
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```
